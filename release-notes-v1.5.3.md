## RaveLink Bridge v1.5.3 (Behavior Tuning + Hotfixes)

This update focuses on runtime behavior quality and release/install polish.

### What improved
- WiZ flow color changes were slowed down substantially so transitions read as intentional instead of rapid churn.
- WiZ brightness now uses more dynamic range (deeper lows + stronger peaks) while keeping reactive punch.
- Color pacing/guardrails were tightened to reduce confused or over-frequent shifts in intense passages.
- Installer now includes an optional setup task to run extra audio isolation tools.

### Included downloads
- `RaveLink-Bridge-Windows-v1.5.3-setup-installer.exe` (recommended)
- `RaveLink-Bridge-Windows-v1.5.3-self-contained.zip` (portable, bundled runtime)
- `RaveLink-Bridge-Windows-v1.5.3.zip` (minimal package)

### Upgrade note
This is a behavior/hotfix release. Existing profiles and fixture routing remain compatible.
