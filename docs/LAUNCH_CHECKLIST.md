# Launch Checklist

Use this after publishing to keep release links, docs, and public pages healthy.

## 1) Public Surface

- [ ] Repo is public (or intentionally private).
- [ ] `README.md` clearly explains Hue, WiZ, music sync, Twitch, and audio-reactive behavior.
- [ ] A GitHub Release exists with a downloadable ZIP.
- [ ] Ko-fi product links to the repo and latest release.

## 2) Repo Profile

- [ ] Repo description is clear and accurate.
- [ ] "Website" points to your main public page (GitHub Pages or Ko-fi product page).
- [ ] Repo topics are set (`philips-hue`, `wiz`, `music-sync`, `audio-reactive`, `twitch`, `streaming`, `nodejs`, `smart-lighting`).
- [ ] Social preview image is configured in repo settings.

## 3) Landing Page Health

- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled from `main` and `/docs` (or your chosen source).
- [ ] `docs/index.html` is live and links resolve.

## 4) Web Presence Checks

- [ ] latest release page
- [ ] If using Search Console, request crawl/index updates for the URLs above.

## 5) Ongoing Signals

- [ ] Post release notes with a short demo GIF/video.
- [ ] Share release updates in relevant Hue/WiZ/Twitch communities.
